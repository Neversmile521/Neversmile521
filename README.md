Hi there! 
🚀 About Me
🎓 As I am a positive, enthusiastic and competent Web Developer, I has built up a diverse range of skills, qualities and attributes that guarantee I will perform highly in this role. I have strong experience working both alone and as part of a team in developing the web projects that require outstanding creative and technical capabilities. I take my work as a Web Developer seriously and this means I always ensure my skills are kept up to date within this rapidly changing industry.

👨‍💻 I have worked both of as an Individual Developer and a Member of the Team untill now. So, I got high skill set for the web development and good team work spirit. Of course, I got several challenges such as User interface and user experience, Scalability, performance, knowledge of framework and platforms and security etc. But I studied all of the web stacks and made it mine through the website development.

📚 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from Sports, Guitar, sketching, and touch typing to some whacky ones like writing with my left hand.
